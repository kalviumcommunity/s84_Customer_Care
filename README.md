  Project Title: World's Worst "Customer Support" Chatbot 
 

PROJECT OVERVIEW 

   Frontend(React + UI+UX)
              ~ Create a user-friendly chat window using React. This can be a window where users can type their queries.
 -Allow the chatbot to send messages with delay to show it has its own error.
 -Display the user’s queries and the chatbot’s response in the same interface.

               ~User should be able to input queries which can be random or silly and get funny bad response from the chatbot.

               ~Create a block to show the previous interactions in the chat so that users can look back at funny responses.
---

   Backend(Node.js + Express API)
    Basic Setup:-
                   Use Express to set up the backend to handle the chatbot's response
                   ~Set up API to receive user input and send back predefined silly responses
       ~Silly Response Logic:-
                   ~Have an array of absurd customer support responses that the API can randomly return
                   ~Make the responses completely out of context, such as telling users to "turn it off and on" for completely unrelated issues.

      Database(MongoDB or other)
           ~Storing User Data:
                  ~We can store interactions (questions and answers) if you want to track users’ conversation history.
                  ~Use Mongoose to manage and store chat data in MongoDB.

      Deployment
           ~Frontend:
                   ~Deploy the frontend on Netlify to easily host the React app.
           ~Backend:
                   ~Host the backend on Heroku or DigitalOcean.
           ~Database:
                   ~Use MongoDB Atlas to host the database for easy cloud-based storage.

---

       ~Additional Features:
                     ~User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles where they can view    their previous conversations.

                     ~Analytics: Track the most common questions or the most absurd chatbot responses.

                     ~Advanced Deployment: Use Docker for containerization or try server-side rendering (SSR) with React for added complexity.

**Why This Project:-**

I chose "World's Worst 'Customer Support' Chatbot" because it's a fun, engaging project that builds my full-stack skills. To build an intentionally bad chatbot, I'll use React for the chat interface, Node.js and Express for the API and MongoDB for storing responses. I'll considerably improve my user management skills through strong authentication and security measures and gain large practical cloud hosting experience by deploying the project on Vercel, Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. This project's development of several absurd yet structured chatbot logic components improves my problem-solving and API management abilities, making learning both practical and enjoyable.
